I've got to say that I've been doing things the hard way for years! I'm a `coder` so... That means using Markdown for everything. But I was recently introduced to [forestry.io](https://forestry.io/ "forestry.io"), and it's made a world of a difference. 

## What is forestry.io?

In short, forestry.io is a content management system that's free to use for single-person bloggers. It scales for teams (which is where pricing comes into play).

But for those starting out, it makes it super easy to manage all of the content (blog, portfolio) on your Professional Data Science Website (if you are using my [portfoliodown](https://business-science.github.io/portfoliodown/ "portfoliodown") package).
