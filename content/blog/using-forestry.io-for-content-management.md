I've got to say that I've been doing things the hard way for years! I'm a `coder` so... That means using Markdown for everything. But I was recently introduced to [forestry.io](https://forestry.io/ "forestry.io"), and it's made a world of a difference.

## What is forestry.io?

In short, forestry.io is a content management system that's free to use for single-person bloggers. It scales for teams (which is where pricing comes into play).

But for those starting out, it **takes the pain away** of managing all of the content (blog, portfolio) on your Professional Data Science Website (if you are using my [portfoliodown](https://business-science.github.io/portfoliodown/ "portfoliodown") package).

It has cool capabilities like code formatting and a lot of fun stuff.

## Where can I learn this for my Data Science Portfolio?

I have great news. I'm adding a new course to Business Science Program, where I'll teach how to create a data science portfolio using amazing tools:

* `Portfoliodown` - My R package that makes it painless to create Professional Data Science Portfolios.
* `Forestry.io` - Used for Content Management of your Professional Website
* `Formspree.io` - Used for creating contact forms, which protects your personal information (e.g. email address) from getting into the wrong hands.
* **Blog / Portfolio** - How to create professional blogs.

More coming soon. Until then reach out in the [Contact Section](#contact) below.
